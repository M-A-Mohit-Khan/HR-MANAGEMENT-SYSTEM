## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/php-project.git
    ```

2. Move the project to the appropriate directory:

   For XAMPP (on Windows, typically in the `htdocs` folder):

    ```bash
    move php-project C:\xampp\htdocs\
    ```

   For LAMP (on Linux, typically in the `/var/www/html` folder):

    ```bash
    mv php-project /var/www/html/
    ```

3. Start your XAMPP or LAMP server.

## MySQL Database Setup

1. Open phpMyAdmin:

    ```url
    http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
    ```

2. Create a new database:

    - Click on the "Databases" tab.
    - Enter a database name (e.g., `php_project_db`) and click "Create."

3. Import sample data (optional):

    - Select the newly created database.
    - Navigate to the "Import" tab.
    - Choose a sample SQL file (if provided) and click "Go."

4. Update the project configuration:

    - Open the project's configuration file (e.g., `config.php`).
    - Update the database connection details (hostname, username, password, and database name).

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

    For XAMPP:

    ```url
    http://localhost/php-project/
    ```

    For LAMP:
